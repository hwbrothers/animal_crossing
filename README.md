# Animal Crossing

## Raw data 

ac_vil_ranking.txt: I copied and pasted the text from [nook.market](https://nook.market/categories/257-villagers?sort=num_wishers-desc
) on May 24, 2020 into this file. It's raw data of every villager, ordered by the most wished for at the top to the least wished for at the bottom as of May 25, 2020. 
villagers.csv: This data was collected by [Nook Plaza](https://nookplaza.net). It's also hosted and documented [by Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nookplaza-dataset). Each row in this dataset is a unique villager from *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*. 

## Cleaning scripts

clean_vil_rankings.R: This script prepares the villager data for analysis and writes the dataset to a .csv in the "output" folder. You don't need to run this everytime. It's just here for documentation.
