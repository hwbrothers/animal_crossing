I copied and pasted the villager ranking from this website on May 24, 2020

https://nook.market/categories/257-villagers?sort=num_wishers-desc

The raw data is in a file called `ac_vil_ranking.txt` 

name: the villager's name 
wish_score: The rank of each villager by most wished, in reverse. Raymond is the most wished for, so he has the highest wish_score, 391
